## Overview

This API client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the [openapi-spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate an API client.

- API version: 1.4.1
- Package version: 1.4.1
- Build package: `org.openapitools.codegen.languages.RustClientCodegen`

## Notes

1. The original YAML files are modified to take care of `anyOf` `enum` values as they are not supported by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) properly.
2. Some of the generated code may be modified to make it more semantic Rust like code (This is WIP).
3. The modified specs files used to generate the code are also maintained. See the above copyright notice.
4. This is a work in progress. Major changes from the generated code will be documented.
